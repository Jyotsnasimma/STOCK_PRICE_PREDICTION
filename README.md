This project demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers to predict NVIDIA stock prices based on historical closing data. By leveraging sequential dependencies in time-series data, the model uses the past 60 days of stock prices to forecast the next dayâ€™s closing price. This provides an end-to-end workflow for applying deep learning to financial forecasting.
